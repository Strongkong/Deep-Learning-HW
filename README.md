Homework for Deep Learning BME

Finished milestone: II.

Currently working on: Final milestone. (This commit is not intent to be the last one. We will upload the final version until Sunday.)

### Instructions to run the jupyter notebooks

We separated the whole project into four distinct notebooks. We created another GitHub repository to store and share files between them, so you can run them separately in any order.

1. [Preparation of data](ks_preprocessing.ipynb): merging datasets, data transformations, feature engineering, data cleaning. The result is the dataset used to train the model.
2. [Data visualization](ks_visualization.ipynb): visualizations of the dataset to help understand the data more in details.
3. [Model optimization and training](ks_training.ipynb): optimizing the MLP NN parameters with Talos, analyzing the result and training the model. The output is the network's weights.
4. [Model validation](ks_validation.ipynb): test the model how it performs.
